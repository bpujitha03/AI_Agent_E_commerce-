# E-commerce AI Sales Agent ü§ñ

This project is a conversational chatbot that allows users to ask natural language questions about e-commerce sales data. Using Google's Gemini API, the agent dynamically generates SQL queries, retrieves results from a local SQLite database, and presents answers in an interactive format with tables, charts, and natural language summaries.
